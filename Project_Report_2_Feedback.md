- Check this out, could be useful : [PaintTransformer](https://github.com/wzmsltw/PaintTransformer) there's a link to their paper in there as well.
- the webgl mesh part (how they do it is quite interesting)
  - like defining the mesh and using it around
  - **try to recreate the webgl website thingy using the facemesh mesh in that framework** -> possibility (if theyre using shaders might not be worth it, too much time to delve into)
- **also interesting to use pychubby and see whats up**
- maybe combine the two: use the mesh to warp the face then i'd have the movement of the mesh, could maybe use it to define a lambda?

guess i can start doing some coding now :)



presentation maybe 15th november 3pm over zoom? 

- anything u present is fine (powerpoint or not, could b)

project report abstract at the start btw (state kind of what uve done), intro (what u do/ what u wanted to achieve + what has been done or is related to what they achieve). in the experiments part, if i get images, i could compare them too with some of what ive found (run their code + mine)
