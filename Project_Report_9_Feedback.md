Regarding the difference (absolute vs relative):

- percentage makes sense (it's more general) -> 
- use the variance of these statistics (**mahalonobis** distance essentially, it gives a value that can be any float (rational number), which tells me how many std deviations)

 2 comparisons maybe?

- how different it is
- and in which direction it is different





Regarding gender difference, it seems like scale is different (~30% or so), but the difference is not different (so mouth would still be bigger in both cases)





can compute mahalonobis distance for each of the face statistics, but also 1 value for the entire thing (if i get a covariance matrix for all of the statistis)

- covariance i want is that of all my training data (same as one given to the mean)
