for plottin this kinda of data, try a boxplot to visualize all lengths of all lines, this allows us to see the median, outliers etc



so for every colored line in my slide #30, I could have a boxplot (probably just input all my raw data vectors and call boxplot)

at new input, 



mean of all lines in 1 vector

variance/covariance matrix (numpy should be bueno)



mahalonobis distance (distance measure) that measures from a gaussian, how many std deviations is the new value away from the distribution

so i could find from all mean lines which one has the highest mahalonobis distance and choose that

I could also compare with euclidean distance from the mean





general recommendation regarding the presentation yesterday:

I probably should've known the 6 presidents before showing their 2 averages

maybe use a flow chart instead of words to show this process



also for the transformation from triangulation T1 to T2, maybe crop a triangle and show the transformation





note to self: when finding biggest ratio in statistics difference don't forget to also transform the new input face into a 600x600 square
