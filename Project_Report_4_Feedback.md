### Schedule where I'm free in the week of the 15th:



Monday 15th : 8am to 12pm - 1pm to 3pm

Tuesday: starting from 1:30 pm

Wednesday: starting from 1:30 pm

Thursday: All day except 11 to 12 am

Friday : Exam day, available after 4pm



### Meeting notes:

regarding the black face:

- maybe the default color space is 8 bit, so when divide it goes to 0
- maybe instead of dividing by num_images, normalize it instead using an opencv function (or even manually while making sure that max value in output is 255)

for the images (for cpp code) just use them directly from the links in the github -> beware though they're synthetic

	- if thats an issue ^ maybe see with idiap for real faces

(sent the schedule)



**Tentative date: Wednesday 17th 4pm**

Final pres: asking if its week on the 13th or week of the 20th? maybe 14th or 15th



for next week: maybe finish what Im doing, then maybe start on statistical analysis (maybe try to figure out pychubby's method)







### UPDATE 7/11/2021:

- fixed the black pictures (let's goo)
- trying to figure out how to convert face pictures to .txt files using dlib's 68 facial landmarks
  - can't figure out opencv2/imgpro.cc issue
    - update: cmake isn't being nice, code should be fine however
