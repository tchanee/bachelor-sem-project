Technically my Cmake is still buggy fsr, but overall the code is working, i.e I am able to find an average face from images (i must convert them into 68 lines .txt file using dlib though).



Now I am looking for statistical methods to approximate a face (or regions within a face) with a normal distribution

questions regarding midterm presentation next week:

- about 20mins of pres and 20 of questions?
- whats the preferred format? powerpoint? markdown? latex?



transforming image into histogram [here](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~acoste/uou/Image/project1/Arthur_COSTE_Project_1_report.html)

however, if I only want to map facial regions, how could i do so? all these techniques map the entire image as is into a histogram
