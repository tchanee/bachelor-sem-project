I was misunderstanding: the point was to use the generated average face and it's landmarks, then do some metric distance calculating like in the midface from landmark X to Y. then when I get new face i can see the diff between the landmarks themselves + the diff in the distance between X to Y too. I could also do some statistics on it, like its mean, variance etc (Check the picture I was given)



for the presentation anything on a beamer is fine. (slides or w/e)

it should be technical enough (since its the robotics group) but en meme temps I'm introducing the project to them for the first time
